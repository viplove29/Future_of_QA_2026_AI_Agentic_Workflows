Future of QA in 2026

AI, Agentic Workflows & the Evolution of Software Testing

This repository contains the presentation deck and supporting materials for the talk “Future of QA in 2026”, which explores how AI, large language models (LLMs), and agentic workflows are reshaping the role of QA engineers.

The content is based on real-world QA experience, current industry trends, and a forward-looking roadmap for QA professionals preparing for the next phase of software testing.

What This Repository Contains

PowerPoint deck – Future of QA in 2026

Concepts related to AI-first QA

Introduction to agentic QA workflows

Skill roadmap for future-ready QA engineers

Reference material used for the YouTube video

Why This Project Exists

In 2025, QA teams rely heavily on tools like Playwright, Cypress, and Selenium.
As we move into 2026, traditional automation alone is no longer sufficient.

QA engineers must evolve from writing and maintaining test scripts to designing intelligent quality systems.

This repository aims to help QA engineers:

Understand where QA is heading

Learn which skills will matter next

Prepare for an AI-augmented QA role

Key Topics Covered

Evolution of QA: Manual testing to automation to AI-driven QA

Limitations of traditional test automation

Role of LLMs in software testing

What agentic QA means in practice

AI agents for test generation, maintenance, and execution

Why AI will not replace QA engineers

QA engineer skill roadmap for 2026

Who This Is For

This repository is intended for:

QA engineers

SDETs

Automation testers

Test architects

Software engineers interested in testing

Professionals planning a career in AI-driven QA

QA Engineer Roadmap for 2026

To remain relevant, QA engineers should focus on:

Strong coding fundamentals (JavaScript, Python)

Modern automation tools such as Playwright and Cypress

Understanding LLMs and prompt engineering

Designing and orchestrating agentic workflows

Risk-based testing and system-level quality thinking
